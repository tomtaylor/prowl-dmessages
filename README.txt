This is dead simple. It takes your Twitter Direct Messages and forwards them to Prowl, so you can receive them as push notifications on your iPhone. 

Copy prowl-dmessages-config.yml.example to prowl-dmessages-config.yml, and edit the config to your own.

You probably want to run this in a cronjob every few minutes.
